backbone-simpleapp-kitlers
==========================

A very simple Backbone.js demo app I live-coded in 10 minutes at ParisJS #18. Features face detection of Kitlers!

How to run:

$ npm install express request
(yes I didn't bother to do a package.json)

$ node backend/app.js

Then browse to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy some kitlers

You can then use the global variable KLV from the console like I did on stage to test some calls on the main KitlerDB View.
